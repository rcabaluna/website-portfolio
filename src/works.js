		summary:
			"A comprehensive online registration and event management system developed for DOST 10 to streamline the end-to-end process of managing participants for large-scale activities such as RSTW 2023, Handa Pilipinas 2023, and the Regional Health Research Conference (RHRC). The platform provides a seamless experience for both organizers and attendees, from online sign-up and QR code generation to attendance tracking, food and token distribution, and automated post-event certification. Its robust features minimize manual workload, reduce errors, and improve the overall operational efficiency of events.",
		description: [
			"The DOST 10 Registration System was created to address the growing need for an organized, technology-driven approach to managing high-volume events. It replaces traditional manual processes with a centralized digital platform, enabling the collection and management of participant data in real-time. Attendees can register online through an intuitive form that captures essential details, automatically generates confirmation emails, and stores information securely in the system's database.",
			"One of the system’s key features is its QR code functionality. Each participant is issued a unique QR code upon registration, which is scanned upon arrival to quickly and accurately record attendance. This not only speeds up check-in but also ensures precise participant records without the delays of manual verification. Beyond attendee tracking, the system also supports QR code scanning for exhibitors, allowing organizers to efficiently manage the distribution of food, event tokens, and other giveaways while maintaining detailed logs of claims.",
			"After the event, participants are prompted to complete an online evaluation form to provide feedback on their experience. Once the evaluation is submitted, the system automatically sends a personalized Certificate of Participation or Certificate of Appearance via email. This automated post-event process eliminates the need for manual certificate preparation and distribution, ensuring that all participants receive their documents promptly.",
			"By integrating registration, attendance management, resource distribution, and post-event certification into one cohesive platform, the DOST 10 Registration System has significantly enhanced event operations. It has reduced administrative workload, improved data accuracy, provided real-time reporting capabilities, and delivered a more professional and convenient experience for both participants and organizers.",
